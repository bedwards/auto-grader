Subject: 🎓 Something That'll Make Your English Essays Grade Themselves ✨

Hey Kelley,

You know how you're always drowning in essays while I'm over here coding during lunch? Well, I might've built something that'll change your life. I'm talking about an AI-powered auto-grader that actually works *inside* Google Classroom—not some clunky third-party thing you have to log into separately. Picture this: students submit their essays, the AI reads them (yes, *actually reads* them with the comprehension of a decent teaching assistant), provides thoughtful feedback tailored to high schoolers, and suggests a grade based on *your* custom rubric. Then you swoop in, add your signature Kelley wisdom, adjust if needed, and boom—done in a fraction of the time. I'm tempting you with three different ways to use it, and trust me, they play together like a well-orchestrated lesson plan.

First up, there's the web dashboard: https://bedwards.github.io/auto-grader/ — think of it as mission control. Sign in with your Google account, connect your Classroom, and you can batch-grade entire assignments at once, generate rubrics with AI (because who has time to write another "organization, content, grammar" rubric from scratch?), or even create new assignments powered by AI prompts. It's slick, it's fast, and it's already live. Then there's the Chrome extension—I'm submitting it to the Chrome Web Store today, so you'll be able to install it with one click in 2-3 days once Google approves it. This one's sneaky good: it adds little "Auto-Grade with AI" buttons right on the Classroom page itself, so you can grade submissions without even leaving the tab you're already in. But here's the crown jewel: the Classroom Add-on is LIVE right now! You can test it here: https://classroom-addon-6l2ikjrv3q-uc.a.run.app/addon-discovery — it shows you exactly what teachers and students will see. This one lives *inside* Classroom as an official add-on (like Pear Deck or Kahoot). You attach it to an assignment, configure your rubric once, and students get instant AI feedback the moment they hit submit. You just review and approve. It's like having a TA who never sleeps, never complains, and never asks for a reference letter.

The best part? Everything uses MY Gemini API key, so there's zero setup for you—no API keys to configure, no technical hoops to jump through. Just sign in and start grading. The web dashboard works right now. The Chrome extension will be in the store in a few days. And the Classroom Add-on is deployed and ready for you to test (I can add it to the Google Workspace Marketplace this week if you love it). So, what do you say, Kelley—want to be my beta tester and reclaim your evenings? Coffee's on me if you say yes. ☕

P.S. — I tested everything with screenshots and verified every single page. This isn't vaporware—it's real, it's live, and it's waiting for you to try it!
